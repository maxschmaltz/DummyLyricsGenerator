## Intro

`DummyLyricsGenerator` is solution of the Lab 11 for the Statistical Language Processing II course at Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen in the SoSe23. The aim of the lab is to teach students basics of simple web app development with [`streamlit`](https://streamlit.io) and to introduce [ChatGPT API](https://platform.openai.com). In the lab, the students are given a starter code, where they should fill in the certain parts related both to `streamlit` and ChatGPT. The starter code is omitted in this repo.

The app is created exclusively for the course and is introduced to the students at the Lab 11 on 20.07.23.


## Quick Start

The app is implemented with `streamlit` and is therefore hosted on [Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io). It is available under https://dummy-lyrics-generator.streamlit.app/. Note that in order to access it, you need a OpenAI account and API key.
